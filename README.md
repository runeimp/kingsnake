Kingsnake
=========

King snakes eat other snakes. This kingsnake eats viper configs!

Library to allow the use of multiple [Viper][] instances and checking for values in each consumed viper until a match is found or the viper's den has been exhausted.

Handy when you want your project config values to add to or overwrite your home directory config values and those test config values to have presidence over all when specified. Or something along those lines.
